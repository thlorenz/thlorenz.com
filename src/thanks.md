Hey, it's me, Thorsten ...

I am forever thankful to the following people who pledged to support me.

With their monthly donation they are showing their appreciation for my work so far, which includes creating modules like
[proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire) and many more, as well as making future open source work possible.

ALL of you make my day EVERY day 🌞, thank you❣️

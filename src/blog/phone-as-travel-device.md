I traveled quite a bit recently and found my phone to be an awesome companion. It helped me keep track of my trips,
reservations, navigate in the mountains and more. Over time I figured out more effective ways to accomplish particular
tasks with it and decided to share some of them here.

I tried to split this post into several sections that focus on once category of use of our travel companion. In some
cases the tools overlap categories, but oh well.

## Trip Tracking

With _trip tracking_ we mean all tools that help us keep track of plane tickets, AirBnB or hostel reservations and other
things related to _getting and sleeping there_.

### Inbox or Gmail

Inbox offers this super useful feature that automatically groups related emails into _trips_. Below you see some of my
past trips:

When we expand one of those trips we find related flight and acoomodation information:

We can expand each of those even further to get specific details.

Emails related to the trip can be found below. These emails are also available inside your Inbox and are available
offline, however the trip groupings are only available online which is kind of a bummer.

Another handy feature available in Inbox is the pin which allows you to mark important emails for quick retrieval. These
emails are also kept offline.

I used to sort my emails via trip tags, but now use a combination of these two features instead.

Another feature I can't seem to find ATM (I hope Google didn't remove it) is the ability to save attachment straight
from an email to your Google Drive without downloading it first.

### Google Drive

Google Drive is pretty huge once you figure out how to integrate it with other tools.

## Goals

What are we trying to achieve here. Well first of all we want to minimize battery usage to make our phone last an entire
day while it provides it with all the services we need from it.

Secondly we are trying to optimize for offline access. When traveling the world you will find yourself in a lot of
scenarios where Wifi or cell signal is not present.
